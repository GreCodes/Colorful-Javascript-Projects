🌸 **Pink Digital Clock**

A customizable digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed as both a visual design piece and a practical learning project. The goal of this project is to encourage experimentation and personalization while reinforcing core JavaScript concepts.

This clock is intended as a base project that others can easily modify by changing colors, fonts, layout, or animations to create their own unique watch design.

🎨 **Design & UI**

The interface uses soft pink and purple tones for a playful yet clean aesthetic. The clock is centered on the screen with large, high-contrast numbers and subtle text shadows to improve readability.

Typography is sourced from Google Fonts:

Tourney for the digital time display

Schoolbell for the animated footer text

A scrolling marquee footer adds motion and personality while keeping the overall layout minimal.

⚙️ **Features**

Real-time digital clock updated every second

12-hour time format with AM/PM

Automatic zero-padding for single-digit values

CSS animation for footer text

Fully responsive, browser-based implementation

🧠 **Learning Focus**

This project was created as part of a self-directed learning process and inspired by a JavaScript mini-projects course from Great Learning. The course is free and well suited for refreshing JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on exercises.

I am revisiting JavaScript after several years. While I already understand the basics, this project helps me rebuild fluency, practice clean logic, and improve through small, visual, and interactive implementations. It reflects my approach to learning by building and iterating on simple, functional projects.
